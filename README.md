# BookSwapProject

This is an Innovation Project that was pursued during the entire 2021-2022 school year by Berwick Academy seniors Shivani Vora and Parker Douglas. 
The project was to create an application that helped students and families at Berwick Academy trade books so that students could save money and save the planet!
The application was built using Firebase as the backend and Swift as the frontend.
